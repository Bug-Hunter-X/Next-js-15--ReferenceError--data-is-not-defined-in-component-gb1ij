# Next.js 15: ReferenceError: data is not defined in component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a component attempts to access a variable that is not properly exported.  The error manifests as a `ReferenceError: data is not defined`.

## The Bug

The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable named `data` that is not defined within its scope or exported from another module.

## The Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, ensuring that `data` is either defined locally or properly imported from another module if necessary.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You will see the error message.

## How to Fix

Review the `aboutSolution.js` file for the corrected code.  The key is to either define `data` within the component or import it from an appropriate module if it's external data.
